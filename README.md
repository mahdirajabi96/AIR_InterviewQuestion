# AIR Interview Question
This repo has a simple R code in Jupyter Notebook that takes a csv file containing a series of numbers with a negative binomial distribution as an input and generate a series of random numbers with same negative binomial distribution as output. 

It also plots the histograms for both input and simulated data along with the equivalent negative binomial distribution.

This is created in response to an interview question with AIR-Worldwide.
